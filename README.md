delphi app for use smartphone as gui for arduino via bluetooth

hi, sorry for my english but i am Italian:) 
This is a simple and single application that allows you to control different arduino programs via bluetooth without the need to write an app for each arduino program .
this is like a proof of concept , but WORKS!
Code compiled with delphi community edition 10.3 and 10.4 .

The code per connecting bluetooth is a low modified version from :

the autor is (perhaps) Sanghyun Oh from Korea
